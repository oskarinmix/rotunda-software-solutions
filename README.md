## _by Oscar Ceballos_

This is the solution for two exercises for Rotunda Software

## URL PARSER EXERCISE

![Exercise 1](https://i.ibb.co/x3H8dym/Screenshot-6.jpg)

### In this first exercise, i create 3 functions, the first one is two separate url and parameters , i used split method two get two strings

### I validate if the url contains parameters and if it contains i split all the parameters in an array, also split the url names and values into another array , this function returns the url names and the paramas if exist

### The other function return the params parameters as an object with key and value and will be added to the hash in case that parameters exists in the url.

### The hash function validates that names are correct and that url is valid, and return the hash of the url as an object.

## Code was made with Node JS to run it

`node UrlParser.js`

## ZOO EXERCISE

![ Exercise 2 ](https://i.ibb.co/v3gsPpx/Screenshot-7.jpg)

### In this exercise, i created a class Animal and create a constructor with two properties, name and sound, also the speak method

### To solve the exercise i just replace all the spaces preceded with a word with the sound of the animal, so i interspersed the final animal speak method

## Code was made with Node JS to run it

`node Animals.js`
